sustainability-dashboard
========================
This was a prototype for a energy-use dashboard we were building for WWU Facilities. It doesn't work great.

  - [x] unpack ION\_Data.bak to the windows server.
  - [ ] get the sql to find the timeseries data associated with any (resource, building) pair (maybe from StruxureWare)
  - [ ] update query\_database(resource,building) to use this sql
  - [ ] update the url at dash.html:12 to be '/data/&lt;resource&gt;/&lt;building&gt;.json' with resource and building filled in from the user's clicky choice
  - [ ] Make the clicky choices count.
  - [ ]better icons for the resources
  - [x] Replace the table with a CSS-styled layout.
